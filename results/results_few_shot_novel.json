Amidst the urban decay, he stumbled upon a nondescript structure, its unassuming exterior belying the sinister truth within - a clandestine surveillance hub, the all-seeing eye of the authoritarian regime. Dismayed by the realization, John muttered under his breath:\n\n1. I knew things were bad, but this is a whole new level of creepy. I need to report this to the commander.\n2. If I use this, can I snoop on my neighbors too?\n3. So I've been watched this whole time?...\n4.
