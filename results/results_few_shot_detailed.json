Panic setting in, he searched high and low, only to find them in the last place he expected - the freezer. Muttering under his breath, he said:\n\n1. Ah, there they are, hiding in the icebox.\n2. Right, how did I manage to forget them in the freezer?\n3. Of course, they're in the freezer, where else would they be?\n4. I must be losing my mind.\n\n    Answer: 3\n\nSecond story:\n\n    Stepping into the elegant ambiance of the restaurant, John's anticipation for his anniversary dinner quickly turned to dismay as he was informed that his reservation had never been made. Shocked and frustrated, he glanced around the bustling establishment, searching for a solution to his predicament. He said to the hostess:\n\n1. Any way we can squeeze in somewhere? I'm sure we can fit in a corner or something.\n2. It's our anniversary, please tell me you have something available.\n3. Well, I guess we'll just have to eat at the fast-food joint down the street. I'm sure they have a romantic ambiance too.\n4. Is this some kind of joke? I clearly made a reservation, I have a confirmation email and everything.\n\n    Answer: 3\n\nNow, let's move on to the story you will be tested on.\nThe story is as follows:\n'''\nDelving into the depths of ancient ruins, John's footsteps echoed through the crumbling halls until he reached a foreboding crypt cloaked in shadows. A chill ran down his spine as he beheld the eerie sight before him, and he couldn't help but remark:\n\n1. Good thing I brought my holy water, I might need it.\n2. To disturb or not to disturb the ancient spirits... That is the question.\n3. Well, this is one for the history books. 'Idiot gets cursed in ancient crypt' - catchy, isn't it?\n4. I probably should have brought a crucifix or something. Just in case.\n\n'''\nAnswer:\n\"\"\"\n```",
